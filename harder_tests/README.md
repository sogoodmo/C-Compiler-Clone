# CS325-coursework-tests: A collection of harder tests for the CS325 coursework!

Here are a few tests that will test your compiler's ability to handle aspects of the specification which are not tested by the default tests. If you cannot pass these tests, don't panic! As long as you pass the default tests I am sure you are capable of getting a high mark, these tests are for those who want to put their compilers through the wringer!

## Installation

Enter the directory where your coursework lives. Clone this repo, and you should be good to go. From there, just run the test script like you would the default tests.

## Contributions

If you would like to add your own test, please create a pull request. If you decide to do this, please also include a `driver.cpp` file (they are easy to figure out) and add your test into the bash script `tests.sh`. Alternatively, if you just have a test to upload, seperate it in a folder named `[YOURTEST]*` so I know to write the driver for it. Thanks :)
